SUMMARY
-------


RESOURCES
---------
1. **Mehdigholi_Watt_6_Bar_Diagram.png**: Diagram of the walking mechanism. The dimensions can be scaled as needed for your project:
    * R2 = 1.
    * R2' = 1.
    * R1 = 1.875
    * R3 = 4.6875
    * R3' = 2.3125
    * R4 = 2.3125
    * R5 = 3.8125
    * R6 = 4.6875
2. **Watt 6-bar Walking Mechanism with Straight and Parallel.pdf**: Class presentation on the project
3. The original paper by Mehdigholi and Akbarnejad describing the walking mechanism can be found here (open access):
