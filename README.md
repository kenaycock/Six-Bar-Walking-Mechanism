# Watt's Six-Bar-Walking-Mechanism
*A Walking Mechanism with Straight and Parallel Leg Motion*

SUMMARY
-------
As part of an undergraduate kinematics course at BYU-Idaho in 2011, some fellow students and I built a prototype of the walking mechanism presented in Mehdigholi and Akbarnejad's paper "Optimization of Watt's Six-bar Linkage to Generate Straight and Parallel Leg Motion" (2008). 

A diagram of the linkage was included in the paper, but the links were not drawn to scale. We optimiazed the linkage lengths in Mathematica using a brute-force approach.

Although our prototype was relatively crude, our YouTube videos on the project have reached over 30,000 views (collectively), and I recieve e-mails regularly requesting more details on the project. I hope that uploading the files here will inspire others to create higher-quality physical prototypes of this interesting mechanism! (freeing up my inbox may also be a motivation :) )

    * R2' = 1.
    * R1 = 1.875
    * R3 = 4.6875
    * R3' = 2.3125
    * R4 = 2.3125
    * R5 = 3.8125
    * R6 = 4.6875
